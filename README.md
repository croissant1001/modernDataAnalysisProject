Water security issue has been extremely serious in the recent years due to the conflict between huge water demand, consumption and pollution because of the increasing population size around the world and the limited water resources. In order to have a deeper insight into the current global situation, we collected the relevant data about our target variables from 1988 to 2017 to conduct some research, including data visualization map about the water shortage, using dimension reduction and clustering method to make a classification among countries based on different levels of water efficiencies and consumptions, and also making the forecasting about the future water shortage values.
